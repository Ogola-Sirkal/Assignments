Set Theory Assignment – Real-Life Applications with Animals & Traffic
Scenario:
Three cars (including Mary’s) approach a highway junction with three options: Left (L), Straight (S), or Right (R).

Sets Modeled:
A: All 3 cars go in the same direction

B: All 3 cars go in different directions

C: Exactly 2 cars turn right

D: Exactly 2 cars go in the same direction

Advanced Operations:
𝐶
∩
𝐷
C∩D: Outcomes where 2 cars turn right and 2 go same direction

𝐶
∪
𝐷
C∪D: Outcomes with either condition

𝐷
′
D 
′
 : All outcomes except those with exactly 2 cars going the same direction

Concepts Applied:
Exhaustive enumeration of outcomes (total of 27)

Filtering using set conditions

Understanding how real-world probabilities can emerge from discrete sets

🔧 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Python set data structure

matplotlib_venn (optional for visualizing set relations)

📂 File Provided
